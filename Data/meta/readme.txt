# Data/meta Directory

This folder contains metadata and auxiliary data files that are essential for data processing and analysis but are not primary datasets.


## Guidelines

### For Manually Edited Data:
- Include both the original file and the edited version
- Provide clear instructions on how to reproduce the edits
- Use descriptive naming (e.g., "codebook_original.csv" and "codebook_edited.csv")

### File Organization:
- Keep related files grouped together
- Document any transformations or modifications made

## Examples

- Codebooks for data joins
- Reference tables
- Lookup dictionaries
- Manually curated classifications
- Correction files for data quality issues

This ensures reproducibility and transparency in the analysis workflow.
